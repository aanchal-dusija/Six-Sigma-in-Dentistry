# Six Sigma in Dentistry: A Vision To Improve Quality Standards
This repository is a detailed exploration into the application of Six Sigma methodology to enhance the quality and efficiency of dental clinic operations. The project focuses on a case study of Signature Smiles, a multispecialty dental clinic chain in Mumbai, India, aiming to improve service quality and patient experience through rigorous data-driven approaches.

## Project Overview
Our project delves into the core of operations at Signature Smiles, applying the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) process to identify and eliminate defects in service and treatment processes. The primary objective is to minimize waiting time, enhance treatment predictability, and ensure consistent service quality.

## Key Concepts
- Introduction to Six Sigma: Understanding the principles of Six Sigma and its application in healthcare, particularly dentistry.
- DMAIC Methodology: Detailed application of the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control phases tailored to dental clinic operations.
- Case Study - Signature Smiles: A focused study on applying Six Sigma to reduce waiting times, standardize treatment procedures, and optimize resource allocation at Signature Smiles.

## Repository Contents
- Six Sigma Report: A comprehensive report detailing every phase of the DMAIC process, data analysis, findings, and recommendations.
- Data Collection: Primary and secondary data collected from the Signature Smiles Juhu branch, including patient waiting times, service times, and staff feedback.
- Statistical Analyses: Detailed statistical tests and process capability analysis used to understand the current system and measure improvements.
